Note to contributors:

Order this CSS code based on this method:

1. Divid several css elements according to the structure of what you're styling
   Ex. This Nav bar is composed of submenus, those submenus are composed of expand/collapse
       arrows, headers and rows of buttons. These rows of buttons are composed of... Etc.

2. Organise those categories and inside those categories according to the alphabetical
   order.

3. Always pick up explicit names for your classes, ids, etc.

4. Comment the scope of your various css styles, what they are for,
   why you chose this solution, who you are and I can contact you

Any code which doesn't these rules may be discarded.

Thank you very much for your interest in this project! I look forward working with you!

See you!
